# Chapter-2 Linear Algebra

## Definations

* **Scalars:** Just a number.
* **Vector:** Array of numbers.
* **Matrices:** A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers.
* **Tensors:** an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with avariable number of axes is known as a tensor.
* **Span:**The span of a set of vectors is the set of all points obtainable by linear combination of the original vectors.
* **Singular matrix:** A square matrix with linearly dependent columns is known as singular.
* **Norms:** Functions to measure the size of the vectors.
* **Eigendecomposition:** we decompose a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
* **Eigenvector:** An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that multiplication by A alters only the scale of v: Av = λ v .
* **λ:** Eigenvalue
* **Trace operator:** The trace operator gives the sum of all of the diagonal entries of a matrix.

## Important Points

* Principal component analysis(PCA) can be derived with linear algebra.
* Write the proof of PCA as an exercise(recommended by author).
