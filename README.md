Notes of deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
Deep learning book also called as the bible of deep learning. A 800 pages thick book which is quite hard to read, due to the availability of this book in HTML format and hardcopy format only.
This is my small initiative to understand the book in a better way and also make a manual where I or someone else can refer anytime for any DL reference.
